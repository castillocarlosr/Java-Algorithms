Data-Structures and Algorithms codede only in Java


#### Code Challenges

*  This is me breaking into Java.
&nbsp;
* I've looked at Java code many times but rarely got the chance to type in Java.  So this is me keeping my skills sharp by typing in Java.
&nbsp;
- I get asked technical questions in different languages I hardly touch but usually read.
- So this is me practicing in the languages I hardly use.
- Expect PHP, Python, and Ruby to follow, as I get asked these questions as well.

- Note:  I mostly code in C# and sometimes in JavaScript.

* This is a continuing repo for all  code challenges.

* Challenges using Visual Studio Code IDE.
